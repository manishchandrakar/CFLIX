## Project Description

Welcome to CFlix, a dynamic movie streaming website developed as part of the Railworld India Demo Project. CFlix is a frontend platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to provide users with an immersive movie-watching experience reminiscent of popular streaming services. Our team's focus was to create an intuitive interface with seamless navigation, ensuring users can easily discover and enjoy their favorite movies.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure signup and login functionality for user accounts.
- **Extensive Movie Library:** Access a vast collection of movies spanning various genres.
- **Efficient Search:** Implement a robust search feature to quickly find desired titles.
- **Preview Trailers:** Allow users to watch trailers and previews directly on the platform.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure optimal viewing experience across all devices.

## TMDB and OMDB APIs

CFlix utilizes TMDB (The Movie Database) and OMDB (Open Movie Database) APIs to dynamically fetch movie details and enrich the user experience. TMDB provides comprehensive movie information such as titles, genres, ratings, and more, while OMDB supplements this with additional metadata and details about individual movies.

### How to Use TMDB and OMDB APIs

1. **Obtain API Keys:** Register for API keys from TMDB `(https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)` and OMDB `(http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)` websites.
2. **Integrate API Keys:** Replace the placeholder API keys in the project code with your own keys. Ensure to include the API keys in the appropriate JavaScript files where API requests are made.
3. **Fetch Movie Data:** CFlix dynamically fetches movie details from TMDB and OMDB APIs using AJAX requests. For instance, when a user explores the movie library, the JavaScript code sends requests to TMDB to fetch trending movies, displaying them on the interface. Similarly, when users search for specific movies, the search query is sent to OMDB API to retrieve relevant movie details.
